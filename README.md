# arduino_clion_template
Clion project template for arduino. Just for code edit. Lack of upload, debug.

Arduino IDE is poor for coding. It does not support code completing, hint, interceptor and navigation.
On windows, we can use VS2017 + visualmarco as arduino IDE. On MAC, embedXcode aimmed same target.
